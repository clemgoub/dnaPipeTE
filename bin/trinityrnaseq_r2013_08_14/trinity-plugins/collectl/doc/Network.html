<center><h1>Network Monitoring</h1></center>
<p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

As with other subsystems which contain instance data, you can monitor both <a href=WhySummary.html>summary</a>
(in brief and verbose modes) and detail data.  Like disk data, the key brief mode values are bytes and packets
(rather than iops).  The actual data comes from /proc/net/dev.
<p>
The one key thing to keep in mind with network data is that not all networks are the same.  Just like there are
device mapper disks that shouldn't be included in the summary data the same is true for network devices.  Those that
are not included in the summary are the <i>loopback, sit, bond</i> and <i>vmnet</i> devices, 
<p>
Since most lan networks run fairly cleanly and errors are rare, one is usually not interested in seeing long columns
of zeros that never change and so by default brief mode does not include any error information.  Adding 
<i>--netopts e</i> will add an additional column with a total error count.  To see specific errors one would have to
run in summary more and do identify the specific networks on which those errors were occurring you would have to
run in detail mode.
<p>
<b>What about IB over IP?</b>
<br>
Good question.  When using Infiniband networking you typically get an IB network device created.  So does this mean
IB traffice gets counted twice when you monitor both it and network data?  As they say, it depends.  
Some Infiniband data will indeed go over the native IB interface and never show up as network data.  This includes 
MPI traffic or lustre which uses the native IB transport.  However, other uses of Infiniband may in fact be counted
as network traffic.  BUT this is actually a good thing because if you're a heavy user of IB/IP and want to be able
to differentiate the native IB traffic from it, simply look at the network detail data and subtract any IB network
numbers from the native values.
<p>
<b>Tips and Tricks</b>
<br>
Ever try looking for a needle in a haystack, in this case maybe it's network errors? <i>--network E</i> works just
like its lowercase cousin except it tells collectl to only report intervals that have network errors in them.  While
this can be extremely boring in real-time mode, consider what happens during playback.  During the course of a day
you'll have 8640 samples but this switch will allow you to see the one that recorded the network error!

<p><b>Filtering</b>
<br>If you'd like to limit the networks included in either the detail output or the summary
totals, you can explicitly include or exclude them using <i>--netfilt</i>.  The target of
this switch is actually one or more perl expressions, but if you don't know perl all you
really need to know is these are strings that are compared to each network name.  If the first
(or only) name is preceded with a ^, names that match the string(s) will be excluded.
<p>
This switch works <i>exactly</i> the same way as <i>--dskfilt</i> so for use case examples
see <a href=Disks.html>Disk Monitoring</a>.

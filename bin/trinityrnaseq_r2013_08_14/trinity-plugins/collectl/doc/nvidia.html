<center><h1>nvidia GPU Monitoring</h1></center>
<p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
It is now possible to monitor nvidia GPUs by including the option <i>--import nvidia</i>
with the collectl command.  Naturally if you've recorded nvidia data you'll need to
include this switch on playback as well.
<p>
The nvidia module currently reports 4 variables: temperature, fan speed and GPU/memory 
utilization. Other than temperature which is in degrees C, the other 3 are reported as
percentages.
<p>
This module supports all 3 collectl formatting modes, specifically <i>brief,
verbose</i> and <i>detail</i>.  Since there is nothing more of interest to report in
verbose mode, both it and brief mode report the same thing.  As with all other collectl
output modes, brief/verbose report averages (since totals would make no sense) and in
detail mode one can see values for each GPU.  However if there is only 1 GPU present, all
three modes report the same results.
<p>
There is one key thing to be aware of with respect to what data is reported.  Since it
normally would not be possible to report data collected at different intervals in a 
consistent line of brief format, and by default this module only collects data once a minute,
a technique introduced in the import <i>misc.ph</i> is used and that is to always report 
the more recent value collected even if it changes at a different frequency!  In other words,
just because a value was reported with a  specific timestamp it does not necessarily mean
it was collected at that exact time.
<p>
The following example illustrates several of things worth noting:

<div class=terminal>
<pre>
[root@cn10 mjs]# collectl --import nvidia,i=3 -oT
#         <------nvidia------->
#Time      Temp Fan% Gpu% Mem%
06:23:41     54   30    0    0
06:23:43     54   30    0    0
06:23:44     54   30    0    0
06:23:45     54   30    0    0
06:23:47     54   30    0    0
</pre>
</div class=terminal>

As described in the section on performance, it actually takes over a second
to read the data from a GPU and that is visually illustrated above because one can see
gaps in the data being reported.  Since we're running collectl interactively, it wants
to report once a second but when it reads the GPU data it misses an interval.
More specifically, the data is actually read during the interval that
started 06:23:41 and since it took over a second the next interval didn't start until 2
seconds later!  Then at 06:23:43 and 06:23:44, the data read earlier is reported.  At
06:23:45 data is again read from the GPU and since we miss an interval, the next one 
occurs are 06:23:47.
<p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
The interface actually calls the nvidia command <i>nvidia-smi</i> to query the GPUs, which
unfortunately is not very lightweight, taking about 1.3 seconds to query the GPU.
Recalling that there are 86400 seconds in a day and 84 seconds is a 0.1% load, one would 
not want to run this commandevery 10 second monitoring cycle!  By default, a monitoring 
interval of 1 minute has been chosen which will still use a little over 2% of a CPU, but 
it is also felt that most of the time one chooses this option to see what is happening 
within the GPU and one may miss important changes with less frequent monitoring.  
However, as with other <i>--import</i> modules, one can see in the example above that it
is easy to change the monitoring frequency.  In other words to monitor the GPU at 5 minute
intervals, use <i>--import nvidia,i=300</i>.

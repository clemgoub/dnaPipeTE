.TH COLLECTL 1 "APRIL 2003" LOCAL "Collectl" -*- nroff -*-
.SH NAME
collectl - Collects data that describes the current system status.

.SH SYNOPSIS
Record Mode - read data from live system and write to file or display on terminal

.B collectl [\-f file] [options]

Playback Mode \- read data from one or more raw data files and display
on terminal

.B collectl \-p file1 [file2 ...] [options]

.SH OPTIONS

Record Mode

In this mode data is taken from a 
.BR live
system and either displayed on the
terminal or written to one or more files or a socket.

.B "--align"
.RS
If the HiRes modules is present, 
.BR collectl
sample monitoring will be aligned such that a sample will always be taken at the 
top of a minute (this does NOT mean the first sample will occur then) so that all
instances of collectl running on any systems which have their clocks synchronized 
will all take samples at the same time.  Furthermore, if one is doing process 
monitoring, those samples will also be taken at the top of the minute and so can 
delay the start of sampling up to 2 full process monitoring intervals.
.RE

.B "--all"
.RS
Collect summary data for ALL subsystems except slabs, since slab monitoring requires
a different monitoring interval.  This also means you won't get any detail data which
also includes processes and environmementals.
You can use this switch anywhere \-s can be used
but not both together.  If the system supports lustre and/or interconnect monitoring
those statistics will be provided but the warnings produced when they are not 
available you try to select them with \-s will not be displayed.
.RE

.B "\-A, --address address[:port[:timeout]] | server[:port]"
.RS
In the first form, one specifies an address, optional port
and timeout (the first colon is required to specify timeout for default port).
All data is then written to that socket prefaced with the current host
name at the named address and port until
the socket is closed, at which time collectl will exit.

In the second form one enters the text "server" and optional port.  
In this form, collectl runs as a server, waiting for a connection and 
once established writes data on that socket.  The key difference here is
if the client exists collectl keeps running and will again look for a
new connection, allowing it to survive client restarts or crashes.

The default port is set at 2655 but can be changed \- see collectl.conf.  

In both forms, one can additionally request local data logging by 
specifying a combination of \-P and \-f.  See
.B "man collectl-logging"
for more details.
.RE

.B "\--comment string"
.RS
Add the specified string to the end of the headers in the data files. If any embedded
spaces be sure to quote it.  This can be very useful when doing characterizations or
benchmarking and you're frequently changing system/application parameters and restarting
collectl between tests.
.RE

.B "\-C, --config filename"
.RS
Name/location of the collectl configuration file.
If not specified, 
.BR collectl
searches for
.BR collectl.conf
first in /etc (the default), then in the same directory the
.BR collectl
executable is in, and finally the current working directory.
.RE

.B "\-c, --count Samples"
.RS
The number of samples to record. This is one way of 3 ways of describing
how long collectl should run (see
.BR \-r
and
.BR \-R
).  Note that these 3 switches are mutually exclusive.
.RE

.B "\-D, --daemon"
.RS
Run
.BR collectl
as a daemon, primarily used when starting as a service.  One
caveat about this mode is you can only run one copy.
.RE

.B "--export file[,options]"
.RS
This requests that collectl does not print anything on the terminal (or
send it to a socket) using the standard brief/verbose/plot formats.
Instead it executes a perl "require" on the named file, using an extension of 
ph if not specified.  It first looks in the current directory and if not
there the directory the executable is in.  It then calls the
function "file"Init(options) towards the beginning of collectl and again as 
simply  "file"(@options) to generate the exported formatted output.  See the
online documentation on Exporting Custom Output and Logging for more details.
.RE

.B "\-f, --filename Filename"
.RS
This is the name of a file to write the output to.  See the
description of
.BR File 
.BR Naming
for further details.
.RE

.B \-F, --flush seconds
.RS
Flush output buffers after this number of seconds.  This is equivalent to 
issuing 
.B kill \-s USR1
at the same frequency (but a lot easier!).  If 0, a flush will occur every
data collection interval.
.RE

.B --grep pattern
.RS
The main purpose of this switch is for those users who have discovered there is
some data in the raw files that never appears in any display and have taken to
displaying it themselves with grep.  Unfortunately this method does not include
timestamps and so makes it difficult to interpret the results.  Even if you 
include the timestamp from the file it is in UTC and so needs to be translated 
to be of any real value.  This switch does just that and then some.

Specifically, it allows you to playback a file and instead of processing it normally
it simply searches for any entries that match the perl pattern and reports those
lines prefaced with time stamps.  You can optionally change the time format
with the usual \-o options and can even select the timeframe with --from and --thru.
.RE

.B --home
.RS
Always start the display for the current interval at the top of the screen
also known as the home position (non-plot format only).  This generates a
real-time, continously refreshing display when the data fits on a single screen.
.RE

.B --import file1[,options][:file2[,options]...]
.RS
This loads the named files and executes callbacks to them, which is the API mechanism for
importing additional metrics into collectl.  See the webpage on the API for further detail.

Since these files also include instructions for how to report the output in all the various
forms, you will also need to include --import during playback.  Finally, since the
default is to seamlessly include imported data with everything else collectl reports, if you ONLY
want to display imported data you much explicitly deselect all other subsystems either
by including -s- (note the trailing minus sign) followed by all the subsystems were recorded OR 
simply say -s-all.
.RE

.B "\-i, --interval interval[:interval2[:interval3]]"
.RS
This is the sampling interval in seconds.  The default is 10 seconds when run
as a daemon and 1 second otherwise.  The process subsystem and slabs (\-sY and \-sZ)
are sampled at the lower rate of
.BR interval2.
Environmentals (\-sE), which only apply to a subset of hardware, are sampled at
.BR interval3.
Both
.BR interval2
and
.BR interval3,
if specified, must be an even multiple of 
.BR interval1.
The daemon default is \-i10:60:300 and all other modes are \-i1:60:300.  
To sample only processes once every 10 seconds 
use \-i:10.
.RE

.B --nohup
.RS
Whenever collectl finishes a data collection interval, it checks to see if the starting parent
has exited.  This is to prevent the case in which someone might start a copy of collectl
and then the process dies and collectl keeps running.  If that is the behavior someone
actually intends, they should start collectl with --nohup.

NOTE - when running as a daemon, --nohup is implied.
.RE

.B "--quiet"
.RS
Whenever collectl wants to tell the user something, it assigns a category to it such as
Informational, Warning, Error or Fatal.  When run with \-m, all messages are displayed 
for the user and if logging data to a file with \-f, these messages are also sent to a
log file which is in the data collection directory and has an extenion of "log".  
However, if \-m is not specified Informational messages (such as collectl starting
or stopping) are not reported on the terminal but the other 3 are.  Sometimes the 
warnings can be annoying and one can suppress these with --quiet though they will still be
written to the message log in \-f.  You cannot suppress Error or Fatal errors.
.RE

.B "\-r, --rolllogs time[[,days[:months]][,minutes]]"
.RS
When selected, collectl
runs indefinately (or at least until the system reboots).
The maximum number of raw and/or plot files that will be retained 
(older ones are automatically deleted) is controlled by the
.BR days
field, the default is 7.  When -m is also specified to direct collectl to
write messages to a log file in the logging directory, the number of months
to retain those logs is controlled by the
.BR months
field and its default is 12.  The
.BR increment
field which is also optional (but is position dependent) specifies the duration of
an individual collection file in minutes the default of which is 1440 or 1 day.
.RE

.B "--rawdskfilt"
.RS
This switch overrides the DiskFilter setting in collectl.conf and explicitly defines
a perl regx expression against which records from /prod/diskstats are selected for
processing.  When there are a lot of disks to process, this can be a handy way to reduce
the amount of data collected and actually improve performance since there are less
patterns to match each input record against.
Just remember that unlike --dskfilt which only filters during display, records filtered
with this switch are never even recorded and so lost forever.

As a side benefit of this switch, if you really want to look at partition level stats
you can do so by leaving off the trailing space in the default pattern.

One must be also be careful in selecting the correct pattern since it's easy to get it wrong
and you may end up collecting the WRONG data!  To verify you are collecting what you think
you are, make a test run using -d4 to see the raw data being recorded in real-time.
.RE

.B "--rawdskignore"
.RS
This is the opposite of the rawdskfilt switch.  When specified any disks listed are completely
ignored and will not appear in the raw file.  Typically this switch is useful when you're only
interested in recording a subset of disk statistics.
.RE

.B "--rawnetfilt"
.RS
This works just like --rawdskfilt except it applies to networks.  Unlike disk filtering
which has an explicit default pattern, the default for network filtering is to simply
record all network data from /proc/net/dev.

The -d4 switch also works here, as well as everywhere, to see the raw data as it is being
collected.
.RE

.B "--rawnetignore"
.RS
This is the opposite of the rawnetfilt switch and works just like the rawdskignore switch.  
When specified any networks listed are ignored and will not appear in the raw file.  
Typically this switch is useful when you're only interested in recording a subset of network
statistics.
.RE

.B "--rawtoo"
.RS
Only available in conjunction with \-P, this switch causes the creation/logging
of raw data in addition to plottable data.  While this may seem excessive,
keep in mind that unlike plottable data, raw data can be played back with different
switches potentially providing more details.  The overhead to write out this 
additional data is minimal, the only real cost being that of extra disk space.
.RE

.B "\-R, --runas uid[:gid]"
.RS
This switch only works when running in daemon mode and so must be specified in
the DaemonCommands line.  Its presence will cause collectl to write the collectl.pid
file into the same directory as its other output files as specified by -f, since 
/var/run does not normally grant non-privileged users write access.  Furthermore, 
the ownership of that directory must match the specified ownership since collectl
needs to write ALL it's files to that directory and can no longer assume global
permissions when run as root.

This WILL also require manually modifying /etc/init.d/collectl to change the 
PIDFILE variable to point to the same directory which the -f switch in the 
DaemonCommands line of collectl.conf points to.

As a final note of caution, since this mechanism changes where collectl reads/writes
its pid file, once you start using --runas, all calls to run collectl as a daemon
must use it or it may be confused and exhibit unpredictable behavior.
.RE

.B "\-R, --runtime duration"
.RS
Specify the duration of data collection where the duration is a number followed
by one of 
.BR wdhms,
indicating how many weeks, days, hours, minutes or seconds
the collection is to be taken for.
.RE

.B "--sep separator"
.RS
Specify the plot format separator \- default is a space.  If this is a numeric field it is 
interpretted as the decimal value of the associated ASCII character code.  Otherwise it
is interpretted as the character itself.  In other words, "--sep :" sets the separator 
character to a colon and "--sep 9" sets it to a horizontal tab.  "--sep 58" would also
set it to a colon.
.RE

.B --tworaw
.RS
The switches \-G and --group have been replaced by --rawtoo, which is more rescriptive of
its function.  When specified, it tells collectl to treat process and slab data as an
entirely separate group of raw files, named with the extention "rawp".  These separate files
can be played back and processed just like any other collectl raw files and in fact one
can even play back both at the same time if that is what is
desired.  The only real purpose of this switch is that on some systems with many processes, it is
possible to generate huge raw files (some have been observerd to be >250MB!) and while collectl
will happily play back/process these files it can take a long time.  By using the --tworaw switch one
still gets a huge rawp file, but the normal raw file is a much more manageable size and as 
a result will faster to process then when all data is combined into the same file.
.RE

Playback Mode

In this mode, data is read from one or more data files that were
generated in Record Mode

.B "--export Filename"
.RS
When playing back a file, use this switch to create an identical raw file differing only in
the timeframe being convered, so naturally one must also include --from, --thru or both.
Further, since the resultant file will contain the exact same raw data you cannot select a
subset using \-s.  This switch is actually intended for a support function for situations
where somone is having problems playing back a file and a subset of the original raw file
that covers the problem time has been requested, hopefully allowing a significantly 
file to be posted or emailed.
.RE

.B "--extract filename"
.RS
If specified, rather than actually play back the file specified with \-p, ALL raw data between
the date ranges is selected and a subset of that raw file created.  The rules for how to interpret
the filename are the same as used for \-f.
.RE

.B "\-f, --filename filename"
.RS
If specified, this is the name of a file or directory 
to write the output to (rather than
the terminal).  See the description for details on the format of this field.
This requires the \-P flag as well.
.RE

.B "--from time range"
.RS
Play back data starting with this time, which may optionally include the ending
time as well, which is of the format of [date:]time[-[date:]time].
The leading 0 of the hour is optional and if the seconds field is not specified
is assumed to be 0.  If no dates specified the time(s) apply to each file specified
by \-P.  Otherwise the time(s) only apply to the first/last dates and any files
between those dates will have all their data reported. 
.RE

.B "--passwd filename"
.RS
When reporting usernames associated with a UID, use this file for the mapping.
This is particularly important on systems running NIS where this are no user
names in /etc/passwd.
.RE

.B "--pname name"
.RS
By default, collectl uses the file /var/run/collectl.pid to indicate the pid of
the running instance of collectl and prevent multiple copies from being run.  If
you DO want to run a second copy, this switch will cause collectl to change its
process name to collectl-name and use that name as the associated pid file as well.
.RE

.B "--offsettime seconds"
.RS
This field originally was used before collectl reported the timezone in the file
headers and allowed one to compensate.  Since then it is rarely needed except in
two possible cases, one in which data on two systems is to be compared and they
weren't synchonized with ntp.  This allows all the times to be reported as shifted
by some number of seconds.  The other case (and this is very rare) is when a clock
had changed in the middle of a sample and will not be converted correctly.  When
this happens one may have to play back the samples in pieces and manually set
the time offset.
.RE

.B "\-p, --playback Filename"
.RS
Read data from the specified 
.BR playback
file(s), noting that one can use wildcards in the filename if
quoted (if playing back multiple files to the terminal you probably
want to include \-m to see the filenames as they are processed).
The filename must either end 
in 
.BR raw
or
.BR raw.gz.
As an added feature, since people sometimes automate
the running of this option and don't want to hard code a date, you can 
specify the string YESTERDAY or TODAY and they will be replaced in the
filename string by the appropriate date.
.RE
.RE

.B --procanalyze
.RS
When specified and there is process data in the raw file, a summary file will be generated
with one entry unique process containing such things as the total cpu consumed for both user
and system, min/max utilization of various memory types, total page faults and several others.
.RE

.B --slabanalyze
.RS
When specified and there is slab data in the raw file, a summary file will be generated
with one entry unique slab containing data on physical memory usage by that slab.
.RE

.B "--thru time"
.RS
Time thru which to play back a raw file.  See --from for more

Display standard, extended help message (which doesn't include the optional displays
such as --showoptions, --showsubsys, --showsubopts, --showtopopts) or everything.
.RE

.B --hr, --headerrepeat num
.RS
Sets the number of intervals to display data for before repeating the header.
A value \-1 will prevent any headers from being displayed and a value of 0
will cause only a single header to be displayed and never repeated.
.RE

.B --iosize
.RS
In brief mode, include iosize with disk, infiniband and network data.
.RE

.B \-l, --limits limit
.RS
Override one or more default exception limits.  If more than one limit they
must be separated by hyphens.  Current values are:

.B SVC:value
.RS 
Report partition activity with Service times >= 30 msec
.RE

.B IOS:value
.RS 
Report device activity with 10 or more reads or writes per second
.RE

.B LusKBS:value
.RS 
Report client or OSS activity greater than limit.  Only applies to
Client Summary or OSS Detail reporting.  [default=100000]
.RE

.RS 
Report MDS activity with Reint greater than limit.  Only applies
to MDS Summary reporting.  [default=1000]
.RE

.B AND

.RE

.RE
.B \-m, --messages
.RS
Write status to a monthly log file in the same directory as the output file 
(requires \-f to be specified as well).  The name of the file will be 
.BR collectl\-yyyymm.log
and will track various messages that may get generated during every run of 
.BR collectl.

.RE
.B "\-o, --options Options"
.RS
These apply to the way output is displayed OR written to a plot file.  They
do not effect the way data is selected for recording.  Most of these switches
work in both record as well as playback mode.  If you're not sure, just
try it.

.B 1
.RS
Data in plotting format should use 1 decimal point of precision as appropriate.
.RE

.B 2
.RS
Data in plotting format should use 2 decimal points of precision as appropriate.
.RE

.B a
.RS
Always append data to an existing plot file.  By default if a plot
file exists, the playback file will be skipped as a way of assuring it is 
associated with a single recorded file.  This switch overrides that mechanism
allowing muliple recorded files to be processed and written to a single plot
file.
.RE

.B c
.RS
Always open newly named plot fies in 
.BR create
mode, overwriting any old ones
that may already exists.  If one processes multiple files for the same day in
.BR append
mode multiple times, the same data will be appended to the same file mulitple
times.  This assures a new file is created at the start of the processing.
.RE

.B d
.RS
For use with terminal output and  brief mode.  Preceed each line with a date/time stamp,
the date being in mm/dd format.  This option can also be applied to plot formatit
which will cause the date portion to also be displayed in this format as
opposed to D format.
.RE

.B D
.RS
For use with terminal output and brief mode.  Preceed each line with a date/time 
stamp, the date being in yyyymmdd format.
.RE

.B g
.RS
For use with terminal output and brief mode.   When displaying values of 1G or greater
there is limited precision for 1 digit values.  This options provides a way to display
additional digits for more granularity by substituting a "g" for the decimal point
rather than the trailing "G".
.RE

.B G
.RS
For use with terminal output and brief mode.  This is similar to "g" but preserves
the trailing "G" by sacrificing a digit of granularity.
.RE

.B m
.RS
Whenever times are reported in plot format, in the normal 
terminal reporting format at the bginning of each interval or when when one 
of the time reporting options (d, D, T or U is selected), append the milliseconds
to the time.
.RE

.B n
.RS
Where appropriate, data such as disk KBs or transfers are normalized to units per 
second by taking the change in a counter and dividing by the number of seconds in 
that interval.  In the case of CPUs, utilization (calculated in jiffies) is 
normalized as a percentage of the interval.

Normalization can be disabled via this option, the result being 
the reported values are not divided by the duration of the interval.  This can be
particulary useful for reporting values that are < 1/2 the sampling, which will be
rounded to 0.
.RE

.B T
.RS
For use with terminal output and brief mode, preceeds each line with a time stamp.
.RE

.B u
.RS
Create plot files with unique names by include the starting time of a colletion
in the name.  This forces
multiple collections taken the same day to be written to multiple files.
.RE

.B "\-U or --utc"
.RS
In plot format only, report timestamps in Coordinated Universal time which is more
commonly know as UTC.
.RE

.B x
.RS
Report only exception records for selected subsystems.  Exception reporting also requires
--verbose.  Currently this only 
applies to disk detail and Lustre server information so one must select at least 
-s D, l or L for
this to apply.  If writing to a detail file, this data will go into a separate
file with the extension 
.BR X
appended to the regular detail file name.
.RE

.B X
.RS
Report both exceptions as well as all details for selected subsystems, for
-s D, l or L only.
.RE

.B z
.RS
If the compression library has been installed, all output files will be compressed by
default.  This switch tells collectl not to compress any plottable files.  If collectl
tries to compress but cannot because the library hasn't been installed, it will generate
a warning which can be suppressed with this switch.
.RE
.RE

.RE
.B \-P, --plot
.RS
Generate output in plot format.  This format is space separated data which 
consists of a header (prefaced with a # for easy identification by an analysis
program as well as identifying it as a comment for programs, such as gnuplot,
which honor that convention).  When written to disk, which is the typical way
this option is used, 
.BR summary
data elements
are written to the 
.BR tab
file and the 
.BR detail
elements written to one or
more files, one per detail subsystem.  
If \-f is not specified, all output is sent to the terminal.  
Output is always one line per sampling interval.
.RE

.B "--stats"
.RS
This switch will cause brief data to be reported as both totals and averages
after processing one or more files for the same day or in playback mode.
.RE

.B "--statopts option(s)"
.RS
This switch controls the way brief stats are reported, the default is to report the totals once, at the end of a
day's worth of raw files, if more than one.

.br
a \- include averages along with totals
.br
i \- include the interval data itself, which is the equivalent of -oA
.br
s \- print summary stats at the end of each file processed even if more than one per day
.RE

.B "\-s, --subsys subsystem"
.RS
This field controls which subsystem data is to be collected or played back
for. The rules for displaying results vary depending on the type of data to be
displayed.  If you write data for CPUs and DISKs to a raw file and play it back
with \-sc, you will only see CPU data.  If you play it back with \-scm you will
still only see CPU data since memory data was not collected.  However, when 
used with \-P, collectl will always honor the subsystems specified with 
this switch so in the previous example you will see CPU
data plus memory data of all 0s.  To see the current set of default subsystems,
which are a subset of this full list,
use \-h.

You can also use + or \- to add or subtract subsystems to/from the default values. 
For example, "\-s\-cdn+N"< will remove cpu, disk and network monitoring from the
defaults while adding network detail.

The default is "cdn", which stands for CPU, Disk and Network summary data.

Refer to data definitions on the sourceforge website OR in 
/usr/share/collectl/doc/collectl\-xxx to see complete descriptions of the data returned.

DETAIL SUBSYSTEMS

This is the set of

data from which in most cases the corresponding summary data is
derived.  There are currently 2 types that do not have corresponding summary
data and those are "Environmental" and "Process".  So, if one has 3 disks
and chooses 
.B \-sd,
one will only see a single total taken
across all 3 disks.  If one
chooses 
.B \-sD,
individual disk totals will be reported but no totals.  Choosing

This command shows the first set of headers that will be printed by collectl and exits.  Doesn't

its alias names.  If a name doesn't have an alias, it will not appear in this report.
.RE

.B --showslabaliases
.RS
This command only works on systems using the new slab allocator.  Like --showrootslabs, it
will name a slab and all its aliases but rather than show the root slab name 
it will show one of the aliases to provide a more meaningful name.  If there are any 
slabs that only have a single (or no) alias they will not be included in this report.
.RE

.B --showsubopts
.RS
Similar to --showoptions, this command summaries just the paramaters associated with \-O and
--subopts.
.RE

.B --showsubsys
.RS
Yet another way to summare a portion of the help text, this command only shows valid subsystems.
.RE

.B "--top [type][,num]"
.RS
Include the top "num" consumers by resource for this interval.  The default number is the height
of the window if it can be determined otherwise 24, and the 
default resource is the total cpu time which is taken as the sum of SysT and UsrT.  
See --showtopopts for a list of other types of data you can sort on.

This switch can also be used with \-s in which case a portion of the window is reserved at the
top to fill in the subsystem data, which is currently in verbose mode though a brief format
is contemplated for some time in the future.

In interactive mode and if not specified, the process
monitoring interval will be set to that for other subsystems.  The screen will be cleared for each interval
resulting in a display similar to the "top" utility.  In playback more the screen will NOT be cleared.  You
cannot use this switch in "record" mode.
.RE

.B "--umask mask"
.RS
Sets collectl's umask to control output file permissions.  Only root can set
the umask.  See "man umask" for details.

Write periodic micro-timestamps into raw file at different points in time for 
fine grained measurements of operation times.

.B \-V
.RS

.RE

.B --verbose
.RS
Display output in verbose mode.  This often displays more data than in the default mode.  When 
displaying detail data, verbose mode is forced.  Furthermore, if summary data for a single 
subsystem is to be displayed in verbose mode, the headers are only repeated occasionally whereas
if multiple subsystems are involved each needs their own header.
.RE

.B \-w
.RS
Disply data in
.BR wide
mode.  When displaying data on the terminal, some data is formatted followed 
by a K, M or G as appropriate.  Selecting this switch will cause the 
full field to be displayed.  Note that there is no attempt 
to align data with the column headings in this mode.
.RE

.SH SUBSYSTEM OPTIONS

The following options are subsystem specific and typically filter data for collection
and/or display as well as affect the output format:

.B "--cpuopts"
.RS
.br
z \- only applies to cpu details, do not report any CPUs with no load.  In other
words all entries are zero except for IDLE.
.RE

.B "--dskfilt [^]perl-regx[,perl-regx...]"
.RS
NOTE \- this does NOT effect data collection,  ALL disk data will always be collected.
However, only data for disk names that match the pattern(s) will be included in the summary
totals and displayed displayed when details are requested.  Alternaltively, if you preface the
first expression with a caret, all names that match that string will be excluded from the summary
totals and detail displays rather then included.  If you don't know perl, a partial string will 
usually work too.
.RE

.B "--dskopts"
.RS
.br
f \- report some columns as fractions for more precision on detail output
.br
i \- display the i/o sizes in brief mode just like with --iosize
.br
z \- only applies to disk details, do not report any lines with values of all zeros.
.RE

.B "--envopts Environmental Options"
.RS
The default is to display ALL data but the following will cause a subset to be displayed

.br
f \- display fan data
.br
p \- display current (power) data
.br
t \- display temperature data
.br
C \- convert temperature to Celcius if in Farenheit
.br
F \- convert temperature to Farenheit if in Celcius
.br
M \- display each type of data on separate line
.br
T \- display data truncated to whole integers (some implemenations
displayed them with fractional components)
.br
9 \- any number, will tell ipmitool to read on this device number
.RE

.B "--envfilt regx"
If specified, this regx is evaluated against each line of data returned by ipmitool
and only those that match are retained.  All other data is lost.
.RS
.RE

.B "--envremap perl-regx,..."
.RS
If specified as a comma separated list of perl regular substitution expressions without the
=~s portion, each expression is applied to each environmental field name, thereby allowing
one to rename the column headers.  This can be most useful when running on heterogeneuos
systems and you want consistent column names.

.RE

.B "--nfsfilt NFS Filters"
.RS
Specify one or more comma separated filters as a C/S followed by an nfs 
version number and only those will have data reported on.  For example, 
C2 says to report data on V2 Clients.  As a data collection performance
optimization, if one or more client filters are specified, data will 
actually be collected for all clients as is also done for servers.
.RE

.B "--nfsopts NFS Options"
q.RS
z \- only display detail lines which have data
.RE

.B "--procfilt Process Filters"
.RS
These filters restrict which processes are selected for collection/display.
Using this filter will significanly reduce the load on process data collection
since collectl creates a blacklist of those existing processes that do not
pass the filter and so are permanently excluded from any future processing.

The format of a filter is a one charter type followed by a match string.
Multiple filters may be specified if separated by commas.

.br
c \- substring of the command being executed as explicitly read from /proc/pid/stat.
Note that this can actually be a perl expression, so if you want a command that ends
in a particular string all you need to is append a \$ to the end of the string.
Otherwise it would match any commands containing that string.
.br
C \- any command that starts with the specified string
.br
f \- full path of the command, including arguments, as read from /proc/pid/cmdline.  Like
the c modifier this too can be a perl expression.
.br
p \- pid
.br
P \- parent pid
.br
u \- any process ownerd by this user's UID or in the range specifide by uxxx\-yyy
.br
U \- any process owned by this username

.B "caution:"
the process names collectl tries to match with c and C is the second field in /proc/pid/stat
which may not necessarily be what you think!  eg the name for X emacs is actually emacs-x

.RE

.B --procopts options
.RS
These options control the way data is displayed and can also improve data
collection  performance

.br
c \- include CPU time of children who have exited (same as ps \-S)
.br
f \- use cumulative totals for page faults in process data instead of rates
.br
i \- show process I/O counters in display instead of default format
.br
I \- disable collection of I/O counters, see note below
.br
m \- show breakdown of memory utilization instead of default format
.br
p \- never look for new pids or threads during data collection
.br
r \- show root command name only (no directory) for narrower display
.br
R \- show ALL process priorities ('RT' currently displayed if realtime)
.br
s \- show process start time in hh:mm:ss format
.br
S \- show process start time in mmmdd-hh:mm:ss format
.br
t \- include ALL process threads (increases collection overhead)
.br
w \- widen display by including whole argument string, with optional max width
.br
x \- include extended process attributes (currently only for context switches)
.br
z \- exclude any processes with 0 in sort field (in --top mode)

Process data is the most expensive type of data collected, costing as much as 3
times the CPU load as all other types of data combined.  Collecting thread data
makes this even more expensive.  One can significantly reduce this load by over
25 percent by disabling the collection of I/O stats.  However, keep in mind that
even if you don't try to optimize process data collection, the overall system 
load by collectl can still be on the order of about 0.2% when running as a daemon
with default collection rates.  See the online documentation on measuring 
performance for more information.

A security hole was identified that allowed non-priviledged users to read
/proc/pid/io and guess password lengths and noe many distros retrict
access to the owner or root.  As a result, non-priviledged users will see 
all 0 I/O counts for processes that are not theirs when specifying --procopt i.

.SH DESCRIPTION

The
.BR collectl
utility is a system monitoring tool that records or displays
specific operating system data for one or more sets of subsystems. Any set
of the subsystems, such as CPU, Disks, Memory or Sockets can
be included in or excluded from data collection.  Data can either be
displayed back to the terminal, or stored in either a compressed or
uncompressed data file. The data files themselves can either be in 
.BR raw
format
(essentially a direct copy from the associated /proc structures) or in a space
separated 
.BR plottable
format such that it can be easily plotted using tools 
such as gnuplot or excel.  Data files can be read and manipulated from the
command line, or through use of command scripts.

Upon startup,
.BR collectl.conf
is read, which sets a number of default parameters and switch values.  Collectl
searches for this file first in /etc, then in the directory the collectl
execuable lives in (typically /usr/sbin) and finally the current directory.
These locations can be overriden with the 
.BR \-C 
switch.  Unless
you're doing something really special, this file need never be touched, the
only exception perhaps being when choosing to run collectl as a service and you
wish to change it's default behavior which is set by the DaemonCommand entry.

.SH RESTRICTIONS/PROBLEMS

Thread reporting currently only works with 2.6 kernels.

The pagesize has been hardcoded for perl 5.6 systems to 4096 for IA32
and 16384 for all others.  If you are running 5.6 on a system with a
different pagesize you will see incorrect SLAB allocation sizes and will
need to scale the numbers you're seeing accordingly.

I have recently discovered there is a bug in /proc in that an extra line
is occasionally read with the end of the previous buffer!  When this
occurs a message is written (if \-m enabled) and always written to the
terminal.  Since this happens with a higher frequency with process data
I silently ignore those as the output can get pretty noisey.  
If for any reason this is a problem, be sure to let me know.

Since collectl has no control over the frequency at which data gets written
to /proc, one can get anomolous statistics as collectl is only 
reporting a snapshot of what is being recorded.  For more information
see http://collectl.sourceforge.net/TheMath.html.

At least one network card occasionally generates erroneous network stats and to try
to keep the data rational, collectl tries to detect this and when it does generates
a message that bogus data has been detected.
